simple Bash script that uses the `nc` (netcat) command to listen on port 443. Note that this script is just for demonstration purposes and doesn't handle SSL/TLS encryption. It's important to understand that using this approach in a production environment is not secure, as HTTPS traffic requires proper SSL/TLS encryption.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the port to listen on
PORT=443

# Listen for incoming connections on the specified port
nc -l -p $PORT
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `listen_on_443.sh`, and give it executable permissions using the command:

```bash
chmod +x listen_on_443.sh
```

Then, you can run the script to start listening on port 443:

```bash
./listen_on_443.sh
```

Remember that this script doesn't provide encryption, so any data transmitted will be in plain text. In a real-world scenario, if you're dealing with web traffic, you should use a proper web server (like Apache or Nginx) along with SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure communication.
